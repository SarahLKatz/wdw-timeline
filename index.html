                  The carousel, located in Magic Kingdom's Fantasyland, is renamed to better fit the story behind the attraction. According to the official backstory, the carousel was inspired by a device built by Prince Charming to assist him in training for the ring-spearing event at jousting matches. A second carousel was built closer to the castle to allow villagers to try their hand at this device. With this new backstory, park visitors were invited to test their horsemanship skills and to enjoy their own happy ending while riding the carousel.

                  Located in the Adventureland area of the park, this restaurant is themed around the nearby Jungle Cruise attraction. According to its backstory, the skippers of the Jungle Cruise have opened the kitchen at their headquarters to guests. The restaurant contains three rooms: the crew’s colonial-era Mess Hall; the Jungle Room, former family parlor of Dr. Albert Falls himself; and the S.E.A. Room—a once-secret meeting place for the Society of Explorers and Adventurers.
